# Contributing to go-docx

Thank you for your interest in contributing to go-docx! This document provides guidelines and workflow information for contributors.

> **Note**: This project was completely rewritten in 2024-2025 with a clean architecture design. All code follows modern Go practices and comprehensive testing standards.

## Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Read the docs**: [README.md](README.md), [V2_DESIGN.md](docs/V2_DESIGN.md)
2. **Check issues**: Look for `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted` labels
3. **Follow Git Flow**: Branch from `dev`, PR back to `dev`
4. **Write tests**: Aim for 95%+ coverage
5. **Update docs**: Keep README and examples in sync

---

## Git Flow Workflow

We use a simplified Git Flow branching strategy to maintain code quality and stability:

### Branch Structure

- **`master`**: Production-ready code only. This branch contains stable releases and is tagged with semantic versions (e.g., `v0.1.0-slidelang`, `v0.2.0-slidelang`).
- **`dev`**: Integration branch where features are tested before release. All development work merges here first.
- **Feature branches**: Short-lived branches for specific features, bug fixes, or improvements. Named with prefixes like `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, etc.

### Contributing Process

Follow these steps to contribute:

#### 1. Fork and Clone

Fork the repository to your GitHub account, then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/go-docx.git
cd go-docx
```

#### 2. Add Upstream Remote

Add the original repository as upstream (if not already added):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mmonterroca/docxgo.git
git remote -v  # Verify remotes
```

#### 3. Create Feature Branch

Always branch from `dev`:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull upstream dev  # Get latest changes
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/what-changed` - Documentation changes
- `test/what-tested` - Test additions
- `refactor/what-refactored` - Code refactoring
- `perf/what-improved` - Performance improvements

#### 4. Make Changes

Write your code following the project's style:
- Run `go fmt ./...` before committing
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure existing tests pass: `go test ./...`

#### 5. Commit Changes

Use descriptive commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for STYLEREF field"
```

Commit message format:
```
<type>: <short description>

[optional body with more details]
[optional footer with breaking changes or issue references]
```

Types:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Test additions or modifications
- `refactor:` Code refactoring without feature changes
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build, etc.)

Examples:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add HYPERLINK field support"
git commit -m "fix: prevent empty RunProperties XML elements"
git commit -m "docs: update TOC examples in README"
git commit -m "test: add coverage for bookmark generation"
```

#### 6. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 7. Open Pull Request

1. Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/mmonterroca/docxgo)
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. **Important**: Set base branch to `dev` (NOT `master`)
4. Set compare branch to your feature branch
5. Fill in the PR template:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference related issues
   - List any breaking changes
   - Add screenshots/examples if applicable

#### 8. Code Review

- Wait for maintainer review
- Address feedback by pushing additional commits
- Engage in discussion if needed
- Once approved, maintainers will merge to `dev`

#### 9. Release Process

Periodically, maintainers will:
1. Merge `dev` â†’ `master`
2. Tag the release with semantic version
3. Create GitHub release with changelog

## What We're Looking For

Current priorities for v2 development:

### High Priority
- âœ… **Complete file I/O**: Finish XML serialization and .docx writing
- âœ… **Headers/Footers**: Proper section support
- âœ… **Styles**: Complete styles management
- âœ… **Fields**: TOC, page numbers, cross-references
- âœ… **Bug fixes**: Any issues in current implementation
- âœ… **Test coverage**: Maintain 95%+ coverage

### Medium Priority
- âœ… **Images & Drawings**: Media file handling
- âœ… **Builder Pattern**: Fluent API (planned for v2.1)
- âœ… **Performance**: Optimization opportunities
- âœ… **Documentation**: Better examples, tutorials
- âœ… **Migration Tools**: Help users migrate from v1

### Future / Nice to Have
- âœ… **Advanced formatting**: SmartArt, equations, charts
- âœ… **Comments & Tracking**: Change tracking support
- âœ… **Custom XML**: Custom XML parts
- âœ… **Template Support**: Document templates

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- **Clean Architecture**: Follow the established pattern (domain â†’ internal â†’ pkg)
- **Interfaces First**: Define interfaces in `domain/`, implementations in `internal/`
- **Error Handling**: All public methods return errors
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names
- **Comments**: Document all exported functions
- **Tests**: Aim for 95%+ coverage (current standard)

### Architecture Guidelines

When contributing code:

1. **Domain Layer** (`domain/`) - Interfaces only, no implementations
2. **Internal Layer** (`internal/`) - Core implementations, managers, services
3. **Package Layer** (`pkg/`) - Public utilities, helpers, constants
4. **No `interface{}`** - Use concrete types or generic constraints
5. **Dependency Injection** - Pass dependencies via constructors
6. **Thread-Safe** - Use mutexes/atomics where needed

### Submitting Changes
1. Consider if it exists in v2 too
2. Fix in both if applicable
3. Mark PR with `legacy-v1` label

---

### Testing

Run tests before submitting:

```bash
go test ./...                    # Run all tests
go test -v ./...                 # Verbose output
go test -cover ./...             # With coverage
go test -race ./...              # Race detection
```

### Documentation

Update documentation when adding features:
- API Reference in README.md
- Inline code comments
- Example usage in demo files
- Update CHANGELOG if significant

## Community

- **Issues**: Report bugs or request features via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mmonterroca/docxgo/issues)
- **Discussions**: Ask questions or share ideas in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mmonterroca/docxgo/discussions)
- **Code of Conduct**: Be respectful and constructive
